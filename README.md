# 3_ Pie Chart

- Bar charts provide better visualization compared to Pie chart for categorical data comparison.
- But if somehow you must use a pie chart then take care of :
   - don't use more than 5 categories in the Pie chart
   - Choose colors wisely for quick readability
   - put category name and its %age together for easy understanding instead of corner legends, for easy readability
